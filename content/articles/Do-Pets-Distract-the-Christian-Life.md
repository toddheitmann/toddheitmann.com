> Audio Transcript Episode 1,001 in the life of the podcast, and our question today comes from a longtime listener named Jordan: “Dear Pastor John, What is your conviction about owning a pet? Do you have any pets, or do you see them more as a hindrance and distraction when considering how we should spend our time here during our short stay on earth?”

You can read or listen. Piper concludes with a great summary of one reason he has a dog, Dusty.

> So, what is Dusty to me? Well, if Jesus says: Consider the birds, et cetera, I say: Consider Dusty. She loves people more than food. She overflows with affection without testing your character first. She is indomitably happy, rain or shine. She holds no grudges whatsoever, no matter how she is treated. Her youth at eight seems to be renewed like the eagles. So, if you, Father, so taught a beast with no soul, no moral or spiritual capacities, to live that kind of life, how much more should her master feel ashamed that even with the Holy Spirit I struggle to do those things?
