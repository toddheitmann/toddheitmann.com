> Easter is more than a saccharine, pastel-colored American holiday. It’s an announcement to the world that there is another story, something more than the cycle of violence, inhumanity, and hatred that corrupts every corner of the cosmos. Christianity assigns worth based not on utility or beauty, but on every human’s unique status as an image-bearer of the Almighty. Christ defeated the enemy, and that unleashes a Spirit-led army, in every generation, to be healing agents for the world.
