Great ideas on writing with git. I use something similar for this website.

> Whether you're a writer or a programmer or just need to collaborate with someone on specific documents, and particularly if GitHub makes sense for your needs, I highly recommend checking out Working Copy and its new Files integration. I'm glad I started using this app two years ago, and I'm amazed by how much its developer continues to push the envelope for what is possible with file management on iOS.
