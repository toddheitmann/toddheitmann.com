### Review of 2016

Many great writers and authors posts a review of popular topics and articles from the year. [Trevin Wax](https://twitter.com/TrevinWax) and [Kevin DeYoung](https://twitter.com/RevKevDeYoung) outlined their most popular [articles](https://blogs.thegospelcoalition.org/trevinwax/2016/12/20/my-most-read-articles-of-2016/) from [2016](https://blogs.thegospelcoalition.org/kevindeyoung/2016/12/27/top-ten-blog-posts-of-2016/). This catches me up on thoughts and ideas I missed through the year with their enlightening commentary on 2016 events.

Along with articles, reviewers often discuss the best books from 2016. Here are a few lists to consider:

### Looking Forward

The new year brings new resolutions. With common resolutions scrapped by February, [SMART](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/smart-goals.htm) goals keep us focused on attainable measured resolutions. For a few ideas about specific goals:
