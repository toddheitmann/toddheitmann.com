### Small World

As the world becomes "flat," we gain experience from far off places. Though someone is literally on the other side of the world, we can talk through text, phone or video. Through social media, breaking news instantly appears before us from every corner. This brings the world to our doorstep.

The images and events we discuss and share hit home as people I deeply know live close to and work with refugees on a daily basis. I hope these next few articles will challenge and change some of your thoughts as they did mine.

### [Omran Daqneesh](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/19/world/middleeast/omran-daqneesh-syria-aleppo.html)

For those who do not know [Omran Dagneesh](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/19/world/middleeast/omran-daqneesh-syria-aleppo.html), his image shocked the world as it confronted the western world's cozy bubble with a heartbreaking push into our soul. This picture, worth well more than a thousand words, stirs the heart to *weep* with those who *weep* and *mourn* with those who *mourn*. I hope it awakens a new take on the Syrian refugee crisis for you as it did me. For more information about what is going on, the [Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission](http://erlc.com/about) wrote a [brief FAQ](http://erlc.com/resource-library/articles/explainer-what-you-should-know-about-the-syrian-refugee-controversy) to better understand the situation. Because of the numerous recent events, they recently published an article covering the [Top 5 Stories from the Syrian Civil War](http://erlc.com/resource-library/articles/top-5-stories-from-the-syrian-civil-war)

Unfortunately, this crisis continues unabated. As the world tries to understand how to allow refugee entrance, discussion can center around untrue claims. Mr. Bryan Scott Hicks [wrote an extensive post](https://www.facebook.com/BryanScottHicks/posts/1187326084630475) about the thorough and lengthly requirements to gain refugee status in the United States. This is a must read to step into the actual process Syrian refugees face to enter America. Determining an exact course of response in the region perplexes even the experts.

### [A Family Friend](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/18/opinion/but-what-if-my-dog-had-been-a-syrian.html)

New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof [writes](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/18/opinion/but-what-if-my-dog-had-been-a-syrian.html) about the stark contrast between the response to human suffering and the passing of his family dog. Kristof notes that the same day his family mourned the passing of their beloved family pet, he published an [article](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/11/opinion/obamas-worst-mistake.html) calling for greater intervention in Syria due to the carnage taking place. Unfortunately, the compassionate response seem limited to his dog and not the genocide currently occurring.

Albert Mohler described this effect well in [Friday's Edition](http://www.albertmohler.com/2016/08/19/briefing-08-19-16/) of [The Briefing](http://www.albertmohler.com/the-briefing/), attributing it to "compassion fatigue" as the news bombards us with tragedies daily. However, we are challenged by both Kristof and Mohler to not look away but lean into the tragedies, think deeply and act appropriately. Much more can be done than idle hands and a hardening of heart.

### A Renewed Focus

After reading many of these stories, my broken heart struggled to go on. How can we live our comfortable American lives while so many others experience such pain? John Piper [shared helpful steps](http://www.desiringgod.org/interviews/how-should-we-respond-to-calamity-in-the-news) to take in response to such a tragedy. This combined with a renewed focus to lift our eyes in spite of [setbacks](http://www.desiringgod.org/interviews/even-in-setbacks-god-is-lacing-your-life-into-an-infinite-storyline), calls us to a greater love for God and each other. This pain often reminds me of the worldwide suffering due to poverty, and I am thankful to support [Compassion](http://www.compassion.com/), providing [excellent support](http://toddheitmann.com/why-i-support-compassion) to those in suffering. I am reminded to pray for Syrians and a repentance toward Christ. I am resolved to lift my eyes up, as my help comes from the Lord.
