### Introduction

Before we begin exploring concepts and discussion, we must remind ourselves that these topics are not abstract references, but affect real people and real families. Russell Moore described this as he concludes his article on [Immigration and the Gospel](http://www.russellmoore.com/2011/06/17/immigration-and-the-gospel/).

> Whatever our disagreements on immigration as policy, we must not disagree on immigrants as persons. Our message to them, in every language and to every person, must be “Whosoever will may come.” - *Russell Moore*

We should not only reflect compassion  in our discussion about policy, but also in our care towards our neighbors that we encounter.

> The church must always show compassion, always... A good Samaritan doesn't stop and ask the injured person. 'Are you legal or illegal?' - *Rick Warren*


### The Road

Recently, [my pastor](https://twitter.com/JMHCCC) and [friend](https://twitter.com/j031777) walked from Tijuana, Mexico to Los Angeles, California. The [San Diego Union Tribune](http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/2016/aug/20/border-to-la-walk-aimed-at-immigration-reform/) and  [Los Angeles Times](http://www.latimes.com/socal/daily-pilot/news/tn-dpt-me-immigration-rally-preview-20160824-story.html) covered why they took on the 150 mile trek to stand in solidarity with the hardships immigrants face.

The [Christian Community Development Association](http://www.ccda.org) sponsored [el Camino del Inmigrante](www.ccda.org/events/event/274). They provide a solid [moral foundation](www.ccda.org/about/ccd-philosophy) to call for radical compassionate change to our laws.

Recently, the US experienced a [border crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_American_immigration_crisis) as many children fled from Central America. Unfortunately, the New York Times [investigated and described](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/21/us/in-immigration-court-children-must-serve-as-their-own-lawyers.html) the *literal* trials these children face. This understanding is crucial to viewing immigrants as people, not as numbers.

Noel Castellanos exemplifies this compassionate call for justice. His [story](https://www.plough.com/en/topics/justice/politics/when-love-demands-justice) shows how interacting, caring and walking with people's experiences motives us to call for change. His [experience](https://www.plough.com/en/topics/justice/politics/when-love-demands-justice) with neighbors, not meaning to focus on "politics" or "reform", stirred him to action. *He could not sit silent.* If you read one article from this page, please read [When Love Demands Justice](https://www.plough.com/en/topics/justice/politics/when-love-demands-justice)!

### The Challenge

The [Evangelical Immigration Table](http://evangelicalimmigrationtable.com) challenges us to read the Bible and see God's heart for foreigners. The [I was a stranger challenge](http://evangelicalimmigrationtable.com/iwasastranger/) is a simple step we each can take to begin this walk of our own. I *highly* encourage you to [participate](http://evangelicalimmigrationtable.com/iwasastranger/)!
