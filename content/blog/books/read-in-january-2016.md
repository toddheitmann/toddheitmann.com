An excellent book to begin the year, Lit! focused my reading and gave me a vision for a life of reading. I loved this so much, I wrote a more in depth [review.](lit-review.html) As the saying goes, *Leaders are Readers.* I hope my review encourages you to pick it up, even if you haven't completed a book since high school.

Dr. Meeker draws on her years of clinical experience to teach us the benefits of a strong father-daughter relationship. She offers ten key insights for fathers in relating to their girls.

The particularly enjoyed how the book flows back and forth between general topics to specific examples Dr. Meeker experienced in her clinic. This gives an example of how to or how not to act on the presented subject and gives a bit more insight than just the "theoretical" realm.

Overall, I enjoyed reading it and will definitely reread many as my daughter grows through the years.

Nate Silver intertwines statistics and stories so much, you don't even notice you're learning. From the housing collapse, to baseball, to poker he illustrates how probability estimations are properly or poorly applied and their consequence.

The downside to the well laid out stories is that breadth + depth = length. While the technical mathematical details are light, the book features plenty of citations and footnotes. This is great if you want to dive deeper into a specific topic, but makes it longer than needed to understand and follow key points.

Anyone interested in how probability affects decision making would benefit from this book. The robust examples and citations provide the reader many takeaways for real world application.
