### Classwork

Find everything you need to improve your scores with a well documented approach. Companies such as [Kaplan](http://www.kaptest.com/gre) and [Princeton Review](http://www.princetonreview.com/grad/gre-test-prep) specialize in taking students through core material to raise scores. Their well known name comes with an improvement guarantee.

### Online Walkthrough

Other options similar to classwork provide guided assistance through recorded lectures. [Magoosh](https://gre.magoosh.com/) hosts these courses and provide several outlines with a timeframe for when you expect to take the GRE. They break everything down on a weekly basis or, if you prefer, daily assignments to stay on schedule. Along with this, they host a blog about various GRE topics. This is particularly helpful to get acquainted with the framework of the test and to better understand goals for achievement.

Many other sites offer similar products; google being your friend. The key is to understand their specific workflow, guidelines and timing, and the expected outcomes. The pricing towards these services seem more favorable, while still providing detailed understanding and guidance. If these routes seem favorable to you, make sure to do a bit of research to understand what works best with your learning styles and schedule.


### Self Study

The last option for motivated individuals is self study through books. Available for minimal cost, or free with a library card, it requires some determination and discipline. As said with the online walkthrough, make sure to read reviews to find material suitable for you.

This route worked best considering my schedule and wallet. Two resources helped: [Manhattan 5lb Book](http://www.amazon.com/lb-Book-GRE-Practice-Problems/dp/1937707296) and [Cracking the GRE](http://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Practice-Edition-Graduate-Preparation/dp/0804126046). I found these helpful as each suited a different need.

The math section was my strongest. Since I already understood most concepts and could easily self teach the rest, the 5lb Book proved worthy to test my skill. In depth coverage of each topic allowed time to develop full understanding. This helped remove silly mistakes and verify I covered every known question. The Princeton Review book was too basic, so I used it for a quick refresher of each topic before delving into the practice problems.

The verbal section was my weakest. The Princeton Review book helped cover basic topics and angles of attack for the different types of questions. This proved useful in giving an overview to complete the section adequately. I neglected the 5lb book for the verbal section as it was more in depth than I needed.


### PowerPrep II

The [Educational Testing Service](http://www.ets.org/) that runs the GRE gives software to emulate the testing experience. Downloading and running is simple and allows you to fully practice for test day. Through some forums, I read that it is pretty accurate and would agree with this based on my experience. Make sure to use this, as it helps you feel comfortable with the testing environment and you know what to expect.

### Conclusions

Your schedule and finances dictate the options for study. Either option will improve results. If I must retake the test in the future, I probably will use Magoosh. The ease of self study and the cost allowed me to perform well to meet expectations and be admitted to graduate school this go around. Make sure you do what's best for the way you learn!
