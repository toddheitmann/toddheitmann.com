### Overview

Lit! is split into two main sections: the theology of reading and the practice of reading. By answering the question *Why read?* it motivated me to actively participate in section *How do I read?*

One major appreciation of Lit! pertains to its well organized structure. Not only does this allow you to easily follow Reinke's thought process, but also allows you to quickly reference specific portions of the text.

Lit! greatly benefited me by outline three key concepts: the purpose of reading, a focused reading effort, and actions to take that I can put into practice.

### Purpose

Lit! opens by laying a cornerstone of a theology on books. This orients the reader about viewing reading and literature through the proper lens.

When I first picked up this book, I skipped straight to the practical/action section, specifically chapter 12, *Marginalia.* That was my purpose, determining the most productive way to read, retain and take notes. Thankfully, after reading this, I started from the beginning. The concise theology of reading stirred my soul to read for eternal benefit.  

### Focus

The reader immediately encounters the chapter *Reading with Resolve* when moving from the *Why?* to the *How?* This begins the wisdom on focused reading. Crossway wrote a [blog post](https://www.crossway.org/blog/2011/09/how-do-you-prioritize-what-you-read/) specifically addressing this chapter.

The following chapter gets super practical as its subtitle is *20 Tips and Tricks for Reading Nonfiction Books.* This, followed by reading distractions, instructs us on a framework for focused reading. While he admits they might not be original, citations littered the pages, as I will discuss in the conclusion. Because of this, the advanced reader might find this tedious, but you can never be too good at the fundamentals, and the thoroughness might bring about something the seasoned reader hasn't thought about before. Surely, through this guidance, these chapters contain helpful hints for all.

### Actions

As mentioned previously, I first skipped to chapter 12, *Marginalia.* This began chapters you can immediately take action on.

Specifically, on the topic of writing in books, I put this into practice at once. Reinke showed how to write in books so when you come back to them, you understand the outline of the chapter and key points within. After starting from the beginning, I reread this chapter for anything I may have missed, and to gain more practice writing in books when he discussed writing in books.

The finishing chapters discussed reading in groups for peer edification and reading in families and with kids for family growth. These chapters gave me plenty to think about how to discuss what I'm reading, understand topics in groups, and to be an example for my family.

### Conclusion

As mentioned in the introduction, this book benefits those who regularly read and those who haven't cracked open a book since high school. One final takeaway from Lit! is the list of citations. After finishing, I had a list of ten other books I want to read, and that's being conservative. The purpose Lit! outlines along with the guidance and practice it gives propelled me to pick up another book. I'm sure you will find it worth your while.
