title: Read In Summer
subtitle: Slowlying pressing on, little by little.
author: Todd Heitmann
description: Big ideas and thought provoking content remain from the little material I covered this summer, Desiring God by John Piper and The Gospel Of The Kingdom by George Eldon Ladd.
summary: While this summer stirred around time, I found some to go over these two books. Ideally, I cover more ground to read about different topics, but these books stuck with me. While other life events distracted and pulled time from covering more material, I appreciate the depth of content I covered. Desiring God by John Piper and The Gospel of the Kingdom by George Eldon Ladd are remarkable books I highly recommend.

### Summer Season's Stir

While this summer stirred around time, I found some to go over these two books. Ideally, I cover more ground to read about different topics, but these books stuck with me. While other life events distracted and pulled time from covering more material, I appreciate the depth of content I covered. Desiring God by John Piper and The Gospel of the Kingdom by George Eldon Ladd are remarkable books I highly recommend.

### [Desiring God](http://www.desiringgod.org/books/desiring-god)
#### [by John Piper](https://twitter.com/johnpiper)

The first time I opened this book, I found it repetitive and boring. It felt as though this common phrase was on repeat:

> God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in him.
>
> *\- John Piper*

At the time, I stopped after the first chapter becoming tired of the repetition. However, a few years later, I wanted to take another go receiving much help from *When I Do Not Desire God* some time ago. During this second try, I found the book much more enlightening due to changes in life circumstances.

The concept that still racks my brain focuses on our ultimate delight. Piper begins the book by invoking C.S. Lewis from *The Weight of Glory and Other Addresses*:

> Our Lord finds our desires not too strong, but too weak... We are far too easily pleased.
>
> *\- C.S. Lewis*

Intertwining this concept with the previous quote, Piper lays out what this looks life in different areas of our life. I highly recommend this books as one of the most helpful in my life.

### [The Gospel of the Kingdom](https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/0802812805/)
#### by George Eldon Ladd

I recommend this book to anyone wanting to know more about the kingdom of God. This accessible book appears to take concepts from the academic [The Presence Of The Future](https://www.amazon.com/Presence-Future-Eschatology-Biblical-Realism/dp/0802815316), packing great detail into a small book.

Oswald J. Smith succinctly summarizes the book's main concept in the introduction.

> The Kingdom of God is basically the rule of God. It is God's reign, the Devine sovereignty in action. God's reign, however, is manifested in several realms, and the Gospels speak of entering into the Kingdom of God both today and tomorrow. God's reign manifests itself both in the future and in the present and thereby creates both a future realm and a present realm in which man may experience the blessings of His reign.

I appreciate the insight it offers for living between the times, the already and the yet to come.
