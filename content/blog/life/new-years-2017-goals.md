subtitle: Writing Down To Live Out
author: Todd Heitmann
description: The new year beckons reflection, but for a greater eternal good. I take a look at a few changes I plan to work towards.
summary: David Mathis wrote a great article outlining why resolutions are not enough. My take this year focuses on thinking better, but with SMART goals. I outline these as goals and not resolutions as I plan to adjust accordingly. Jonathan Edwards models true resolutions, of which I aspire to detail one day.

### Resolutions?

[David Mathis](https://twitter.com/davidcmathis) wrote a great article outlining why [resolutions are not enough](http://www.desiringgod.org/articles/resolutions-are-not-enough). This year focuses on thinking better, but with [SMART](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/smart-goals.htm) goals. I outline these as goals and not resolutions as I plan to adjust accordingly. Jonathan Edwards models true [resolutions](http://www.desiringgod.org/articles/the-resolutions-of-jonathan-edwards), of which I aspire to detail one day.

### 2017 Goals

- Read the whole Bible

- Read the Gospels, Psalms and Proverbs every month

- Read 12 books

- Memorize a verse per week

- Write monthly updates holding myself accountable

Most of these goals focus on intake. I believe that as I read, learn, and think deeply, these affect my actions. By giving a reason for change, my focus narrows to act it out.

### Future Development

This list leaves room for winnowing or growth. I plan to consider [Donald Whitneyâ€™s](https://twitter.com/DonWhitney) [10 Questions](http://biblicalspirituality.org/10-questions-to-ask-at-the-start-of-a-new-year-or-on-your-birthday/) in the future with the purpose of reflection on actions. These two make prospect give me focus, but help me avoid the [hyper-examined life not worth living](http://resources.thegospelcoalition.org/library/the-hyper-examined-life-is-not-worth-living-in-2017).
