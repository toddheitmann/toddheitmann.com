summary: Compassion's holistic child development centers are unashamedly Christ centered. Jesus is their example when he grew "in wisdom and stature and in favor with God and man." At compassion centers, they focus on all these areas, not just wisdom (life skills and job training) and stature (physical health and personal hygiene).

### Christ Centered

Compassion's holistic child development centers are unashamedly [Christ centered](http://www.compassion.com/about/commitment-to-christ.htm). Jesus is their example when he grew "in wisdom and stature and in favor with God and man." At compassion centers, they focus on all these areas, not just wisdom (life skills and job training) and stature (physical health and personal hygiene).

Please do not mistake this as apathy for relief from poverty and the harsh circumstances people reside in. God the creator formed these kids in His image and cares for them more than we ever could. We should support organizations that care well for the physical needs of those in poverty. Moreover, when we care for people, we must move beyond "social media activism" as described in [Christ and Pop Culture](http://christandpopculture.com/loving-the-poor-pics-or-it-didnt-happen/). Care for the marginalized should be expressed in our love and time with them, not limited to our pocketbooks or posts.

Most organizations focusing on this fall short regarding spiritual healing. This is understandable as the seemingly insurmountable physical needs become overwhelming, deserving of our complete attention. Visiting these areas brands in your mind images of the immense need for relief. However, what good is it for man to gain the world, yet loose his soul?

I refuse to believe that physical strengthening and spiritual strengthening are mutually exclusive. Compassion shows us how to excel at both. We should display the same excellence in our lives, working as worship to the glory of God while spreading the good news of the Word made flesh.

### Financial Integrity

Compassion's recognition for financial integrity and transparency is second to none. They continually receive awards for their financial integrity and elevate stewardship to a passion and deeply held value.

Because of their first-class fiscal responsibility, your giving goes straight towards what matters most, the children. They benefit directly from your financial contributions with more than 80% going to front line expenses. This is crucial as many nonprofits accrue high G&A expenses, which has come into [public light](http://www.cnn.com/2013/06/13/us/worst-charities/index.html) in [recent years](http://www.tampabay.com/americas-worst-charities/).

Here are a few rankings from their [website](http://www.compassion.com/about/financial.htm):

- Forbes ranks Compassion 14th on its 50 Largest U.S. Charities List

- The NonProfit Times ranks Compassion 25th on its Top 100 List

- Chronicle of Philanthropy ranks Compassion 22nd on its Philanthropy 400 list

- Compassion ranks 2nd on Charity Navigator's list of 10 Charities with the Most Consecutive 4-Star Ratings

When combined with the Christ centered approach they take, this gives compassion a powerful approach to change the lives of kids *and* their sponsors.

### Focus on Excellence

The best organizations create a process for continual improvement. Economicists approached child sponsor programs to assess them on a scientific level to answer the question: Do Child Sponsor Programs Work? Only one organization gave the required access for a full assessment, not afraid from the outcome. Should the result show no difference between sponsored and unsponsored children, real changes can be made to improve. However, Compassion was confident of a positive outcome based on their years of experience seeing children released from poverty in Jesus' name.

The full [research report](https://68e120ee-a-f00c7fac-s-sites.googlegroups.com/a/usfca.edu/wydick/home/research/csp.pdf?attachauth=ANoY7cpiHSkpIRa6qSvtFqTgQ92s8xpinOaeoG_-FSCt6fbm4sLZDcwTebfjvauGKXiGY2rrAA6j0wWBb3SPFaW3L-0z39oGtLTLVYUVMq5zbf3ve6vnRWbDkBV9eP4FM62algzp-bg3u7St7CzHtn_ZqM10BkQcIWBl2kkGQ10bc8DLiPLMf5lg5E6M79FljJR4dqUXNSIvcPg5tXLpPncjAQ7mySlwhQ%3D%3D&attredirects=0) details the positive outcome of their program, as well as future work to come. I encourage you to read it in its entirety. To find the main takeaways, check out [Compassion's summary](http://www.compassion.com/does-child-sponsorship-work.htm) of the data. A few highlights are:

- Participants are 50 to 80 percent more likely to complete a university education than non-sponsored children.

- Participants are 30 to 75 percent more likely to become community leaders as adults than their non-sponsored peers.

Their future work appears very interesting as it seeks to understand the casual link for these outcomes. While correlation of data helps predictive modeling, causal relationships provide proof of concept. The concluding paragraph from their research paper explains:

>Traditionally, development economics...has focused on the relief of external constraints such as school quality, infrastructure, and credit. But it may be that the internal constraints of the poor also contribute to poverty traps in important ways. Further observational and experimental research should seek to better understand the internal constraints faced by the poor, and how development efforts that seek to release internal constraints can complement purely economic interventions and incentives.

To break this down:

- Traditional development economics focuses solely on access to schools, drinking water, electricity etc... with  aid relief concentrated on removing these barriers as key to economic expansion.

- Future studies put focus on how emotions and self-assessment affect adult outcomes. Addressing this could change the way development economics works in the future.

- This could support Compassion's holistic model of growth, rather than economic stimulus only.

Why do I support compassion? Because it works! I hope the first point shows that the focus remains on the individual. "Science" has a way to turn people into statistics, but at the day to day level, Compassion cares for the individual. Scientific evidence backs this as sponsored children grow into kingdom minded adults.

### Communication

Compassion continues their excellence through the way you communicate with the organization and with sponsored children. They offer many outlets to connect via web, apps and good old fashioned snail mail.

Three times a year Compassion produces a quality [magazine](http://magazine.compassion.com/) filled with interesting articles. The gorgeous design draws you into their world. It's available in all forms of media: web, app and print. They provide you a peak into the world of Compassion and experiences of the sponsored kids. Very informative, it gives you a sense of the connection they make with each kid, and their impact on the community.

Compassion provides direct communication with your sponsored child through letters, and allows you to send as many as you can write. Compassion makes this process a breeze, and if writing seems intimidating, they give prompts for you to write about. Logging into your account makes the web app available, where you write your content, upload pictures and even choose the paper to print the letter on. For those more inclined for handwritten notes, they offer templates as suggestions or, if you choose, your own letterhead and paper can be sent.

Compassion supports many other ways to connect with them and get involved. We toured their headquarters in Colorado Springs, which was quite an experience. They speak in greater detail about the life of the children they serve, their organization's role in the local community, and a birds eye view of the operations. I highly recommend it if you find yourself in the Springs area.

Compassion organizes trips to meet your sponsored child, and I hope one day to do this. There is something unique about going yourself, not only sending gifts or letters. Remember that while dead in our sin, God didn't just send angels, a sign or a book. He sent himself.

Compassion also brings the action to you with the compassion tour, helps churches learn more through compassion Sunday, and many other means. I appreciate their dedication to communication through beautiful designs, well organized events, and easy ways to connect.

### Conclusion

I thoroughly enjoy sponsoring two children through compassion and hope to sponsor more in the future! Compassion displays diligent, excellent work and beautiful design wrapped in Christlike *love* and *compassion*. This organization changes lives for anyone involved and well worth the time and effort!
