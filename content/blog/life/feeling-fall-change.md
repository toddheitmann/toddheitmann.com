subtitle: Using Changing Seasons to Evaluate Our Changing Lives

description: As the season changes to fall, we should take the time to pause and reflect. In doing so, we find great benefit to how we live and grow as an individual.
summary: Autumn ushers in a crisp breeze as the leaves fall, hot beverages, and pumpkin spice. I often feel a sense of excitement with each changing season. This reminds me of the verse "For everything there is a season, and a time for every matter under heaven". While the New Year commonly causes a life re-evaluation, I challenge you not to wait the next three months. This new season of fall will yield fruit in your life, if you put forth a little extra thought and intention.

### Autumn

Autumn ushers in a crisp breeze as the leaves fall, hot beverages, and pumpkin spice everything. I often feel a sense of excitement with each changing season. This reminds me of the verse from Ecclesiastes:

> For everything there is a season, and a time for every matter under heaven.
>
> *\- Ecclesiastes 3.1*

While the New Year commonly causes a life re-evaluation, I challenge you not to wait the next three months. This new season of fall will yield fruit in your life, if you put forth a little extra thought and intention. As we move into this new season, what specific areas of your life have been neglected? Take some time to think about what's important, write it down, then follow through to live it out.

### The Important Things

Fall also brings family festivities centered around Halloween, Thanksgiving and Christmas. Before the schedule becomes crowded full of events, prioritize that which you value most. For many including myself, relationships with family and friends suffer from neglect through the year as we busy ourself with stuff and events. We go with the flow not thinking about where the current of life takes us. When the holiday season arrives, we often get overwhelmed with the hustle and bustle just trying to keep up.

The key is to start with what matters most. For me, this is my relationship with my creator, my family and my friends, including those I don't yet know. I love my community and neighborhood, and look forward to meeting new people with different life experiences than my own. If these are truly what I value and find important, how then should I live? How should I schedule my time, especially around the holidays?

### Write It Down

While not the same as goal setting, going through this process helps our minds slow down. When we write out thoughts and ideas, we receive a clearer picture. By physically putting our values next to each other, we envision our lives shaped by what's important.

Writing down these ideas also helps us reflect at the end of the year. Did I schedule meaningful time as I hoped? If not, what limited me from achieving this? The process of reflection cannot be achieved without anything to look back on, and by writing these down provides guidance as we review in January.

### Live It Out

All this thinking is not a mind exercise. Hopefully going over your personal values will motivate and compel you to action. For myself, these thoughts inspired me to diligently schedule evening time as a family. It also causes me to say no and strip out unimportant or "urgent" matters. Saying no to the good allows us to say yes to the best. By acting on these, we grow as individuals.
