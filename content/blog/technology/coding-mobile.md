description: A larger update to the python code combined with the power of Editorial Workflows allows me to write, review and publish all on the go.
summary: A few minor improvements create an easier experience for both the reader and myself. Adding an RSS feed gives you access to auto updates in your reader of choice. This avoids unnecessary email that clutters inboxes and sits unread. While many feed generators exist, I again coded by hand to gain a better understand of the detail within specific xml files, which you can see at the public GitHub repository. I realize nobody but us nerds use RSS feeds, but this extra project allowed me to understand the structure behind the built in generators that exist in platforms such as Wordpress.

### Updated Code

A few minor improvements create an easier experience for both the reader and myself. Adding an [RSS](www.toddheitmann.com/atom.xml) feed gives you access to auto updates in your reader of choice. This avoids unnecessary email that clutters inboxes and sits unread. While many feed generators exist, I again coded by hand to gain a better understand of the detail within specific xml files, which you can see at the public [GitHub repository](www.github.com/toddheitmann). I realize nobody but us nerds use [RSS](www.toddheitmann.com/atom.xml) feeds, but this extra project allowed me to understand the structure behind the built in generators that exist in platforms such as [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com).

Another slight change made to template files. As my experience in web development grows, I learned more about templating and added footer and header options. These non-standard formats fit my needs, but are more limited when comparing to templates through a web development platform like [Django](www.djangoproject.com) [templates](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/topics/templates/)

Overall these changes are helpful in code maintenance as well as user experience, a win-win.

### Updated Apps

I typed out all the python, HTML and CSS in [Atom](https://atom.io), as I [described](http://toddheitmann.com/2015/how-i-built-this-website.html) in a previous post. Since I laid the foundation in python, I discovered an app called [Editorial](http://omz-software.com/editorial/) that allowed me to port my code as a workflow. Now I write, update and change the blog on the go, on my iPhone. This convenience allows me to jot posts down as needed or edit thoughts on a whim.

If you do any writing, I highly recommend [Editorial](http://omz-software.com/editorial/)! Many professional writers back it, and it is so feature rich, I barely scrape the surface in its usefulness. Most of these articles were typed out on an iPhone 5S.


### Updated Experience

Lastly, I finely learned about [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com). I am amazed at how easy making a webapp or website can be! Again, my only background in coding and developing comes from some python scripting and watching some HTML, CSS and JavaScript videos. This processes gave me confidence to explore not only web development, but also possible iOS work as you can implement an iOS app calling web [APIs](http://www.django-rest-framework.org) you write in django.

To get started, check out their simple poll app [tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/intro/tutorial01/).  Once you walk through this, start your own project, use StackOverflow and you will see how simple this is! The hardest part is finding a project that you desire to see built. Once you find that idea, the sky is the limit!
