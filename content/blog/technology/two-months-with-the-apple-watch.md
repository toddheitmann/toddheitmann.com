title: Two Months with the Apple Watch
subtitle: The pros and cons of Apple's wearable tech.

description: After two months of use and abuse, I'd like to summarize what makes the apple watch great, its drawbacks and a brief comparison to the Fitbits available.
summary: What makes the apple watch great? At a glance I can see the weather, my schedule, and the time and date. A few swipes reveals other important information that I configured in the glances sections. I set my notifications to only important reminders or incoming communication that requires attention. This personalization makes the Apple watch simple, quick, and easy to use.

### Convenience

What makes the apple watch great? At a glance I can see the weather, my schedule, and the time and date. A few swipes reveals other important information that I configured in the glances sections. I set my notifications to only important reminders or incoming communication that requires attention. This personalization makes the Apple watch simple, quick, and easy to use.

### Drawbacks

The first obvious downside would be continuous notifications. In our media saturated world, this could be an annoyance, but through experience I believe I have found the right dial between establishing technology boundaries and courteous/urgent response. A good diagnostic of smart phone habits is found in an [interview](https://t.co/vLn3GbjORq?ssr=true) of Alistar Beggs by Tony Reike.

The price deters many, almost including myself (due to some promotions I found, I received a net discount of 33%). As discussed later, a Fitbit might be an equivalent option at half the cost.

While Apple boasts of the many watch faces available, more options in the modal section would truly make this great. The main feature of the watch is quick, easy information displayed at the flick of the wrist. The more this information is readily available, less processing.

Lastly, I found the heart rate to be inconsistent, particularly among exercises of varying movements. One of the big draws to the Apple Watch is the heart rate [accuracy](link). However, as Apple [warns](link) and others [note](link), irregular movements cause incorrect readings.

### The Competition

My friends and family wear different styles of fitbits. Through their use and discussion, I took a glimpse into its usage.

Many previously discussed drawbacks remain. The slow processors do not allow for quick interactions or continued engaged use. Moreover, the singular nature of the Fitbit as a fitness accessory  does not allow for interactive use to push different data to your phone.

The Fitbit shines over the Apple Watch in its fitness apps, both in the numerical display and in social networking. Because of the price difference, more people afford to take the plunge into fitness tracking. This online, in app, community encourages and challenges each other, quite literally. The apple watch misses this, and on some sense, I am left on the outside looking in.  The way the Fitbit app and web interface display heart rate, sleep, and exercise data is superior to the Apple Health app or other Apple Watch alternatives.

### Recommendation

Want fitness tracking and only fitness tracking? The Fitbit meets your needs better than the Apple Watch, at a better price. As you require more features, the Apple Watch will meet expectations much better.

Overall, I enjoy and use my Apple Watch every day as I easily view information, with the flick if the wrist. While sometimes I miss the social aspect of the Fitbit, the Apple Watch meets my needs in a more practical way.
